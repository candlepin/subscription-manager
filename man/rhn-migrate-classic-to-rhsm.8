.SH NAME

rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm \- Migrates a system profile from Red Hat Network Classic Hosted to Red Hat Network Subscription Management (hosted).

.SH SYNOPSIS
rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm [--force|--gui|--no-auto|--servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL|--help]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP migrates a system profile which is registered with Red Hat Network Classic to Red Hat Network Subscription Management. This is intended for hosted-to-hosted migrations, not for migrating from a Satellite system.

.PP
This script migrates configuration, from a channel-based subscription framework to a certificate-based subscription framework. While the \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP script performs the migration operation, the data used to map the channels to the corresponding product certificates is defined in the \fBsubscription-manager-migration-data\fP package. The \fBsubscription-manager-migration-data\fP package must be installed before the \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP script can be run successfully.

.SH BACKGROUND
Access to support and updates for products is determined through 
.I subscriptions.
Subscriptions are assigned to a system, which means that the system has the right to install and update a product with full support. Subscriptions for an entire organization are tracked through a 
.I subscription service, 
either a local Satellite or hosted Red Hat Network.
The system registers with the subscription service and receives an inventory ID number. When subscriptions are allocated to a system, it is noted in the subscription service. 

.PP 
For environments which use a hosted subscription service rather than a local Satellite system, systems were registered with Red Hat Network Classic. Red Hat Network Classic, however, has been replaced by Red Hat Network Subscription Management. The differences between the two systems are described in this Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-45987>

.PP
Registering with a subscription service is exclusive. If a system is registered with Red Hat Network Classic, it cannot simultaneously be registered with Red Hat Network Subscription Management. The 
.B rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm
tool is provided specifically so that there is a way to transition from the deprecated Red Hat Network Classic to the new Red Hat Network Subscription Management.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h, --help
Prints the specific help information for the given command.

.TP
.B -f, --force
Ignore channels not available on Red Hat Network Subscription Management. The channels in Red Hat Network Classic are mapped to the product certificates used by Red Hat Network Subscription Management. However, not every channel has a certificate mapping, which can cause errors during migration. Using this option skips any channels which are not mapped to Red Hat Network Subscription Management.

.TP
.B -g, --gui
Opens the Subscription Manager UI so that administrators can manually select which subscriptions to apply to the 
system. Without this option, the migration script automatically runs 
.B 'subscription-manager register --autosubscribe'
to register the system to Red Hat Network Subscription Management and then apply all relevant subscriptions.

.TP
.B -n, --no-auto
Unsubscribes the system from Red Hat Network Classic but does not subsequently register the system to Red Hat Network Subscription Management or subscribe the system to any entitlements.

.TP
.B -s SERVICE_LEVEL, --servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL
Sets a preferred service level for the system, such as premium or standard. This service level preference is then used as one of the criteria for autosubscribing the system. 

.SH USAGE
The migration process moves the system from the inventory in one subscription service (Red Hat Network Classic) to the new subscription service (Red Hat Network Subscription Management), and then re-applies the subscriptions to the system. The script runs through these steps:

.IP
1. Authenticate to both Red Hat Network Classic and Red Hat Network Subscription Management to verify the account settings.

.IP
2. Get a channel list for the system.

.IP
3. Match each channel to a corresponding certificate map.

.IP
4. Copy over the product certificates for the old channels.

.IP
5. Unregister from Red Hat Network Classic.

.IP
6. Register with Red Hat Network Subscription Management and auto-subscribe to the best-matched subscriptions. (Alternatively, the 
.B --gui
option can be used to launch the Subscription Manager UI to assign subscriptions manually.)

.PP
After migration, the system facts maintained by Subscription Manager display what script was used for migration and what the previous system ID was. 
.nf
[root@server ~]# subscription-manager facts --list | grep migr
migration.classic_system_id: 09876
migration.migrated_from: rhn_hosted_classic
.fi

.SS MIGRATION AND AUTOSUBSCRIBE
The \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP tool can autosubscribe the system to the best-matching subscriptions. This allows migrations to be automated.

.PP
The script does prompt for a username and password to use to register the system; this same account is used to authenticate with both Red Hat Network Classic and Red Hat Network Subscription Management.

.PP
Optionally, the \fB--servicelevel\fP argument sets an SLA preference to use with the system. The SLA associated with a subscription is then evaluated when determining what subscriptions to autosubscribe the system to, along with other factors like installed products, existing channel assignments, and architecture.

The \fB--gui\fP option opens the Subscription Manager GUI so that administrators can assign subscriptions to the system. As with the autosubscribe process, the script prompts for the RHN username and password for the use.

.SS UNREGISTER FROM RED HAT NETWORK CLASSIC ONLY
The \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP tool can be used simply to unregister a system from Red Hat Network Classic without registering it to Red Hat Network Subscription Management or assigning subscriptions to the system.
