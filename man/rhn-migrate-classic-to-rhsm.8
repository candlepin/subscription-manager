.SH NAME

rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm \- Migrates a system profile from Red Hat Network Classic Hosted to Customer Portal Subscription Management (hosted) or Subscription Asset Manager (on-premise).

.SH SYNOPSIS
rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm [--force] | [--no-auto] | [--servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL] | [--destination-url=URL] | [--legacy-user=LEGACY_USER] | [--legacy-password=LEGACY_PASSWORD] | [-destination-user=DESTINATION_USER] | [--destination-password=DESTINATION_PASSWORD] | [--org=ORG] | [--environment=ENVIRONMENT] | [--no-proxy] | [--help]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP migrates a system profile which is registered with Red Hat Network Classic to Customer Portal Subscription Management. This is intended for migrating from the host service, not for migrating from a Satellite system.

.PP
This script migrates configuration, from a channel-based subscription framework to a certificate-based subscription framework. While the \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP script performs the migration operation, the data used to map the channels to the corresponding product certificates is defined in the \fBsubscription-manager-migration-data\fP package. The \fBsubscription-manager-migration-data\fP package must be installed before the \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP script can be run successfully.

.SH BACKGROUND
Access to support and updates for products is determined through
.I subscriptions.
Subscriptions are attached to a system, which means that the system has the right to install and update a product with full support. Subscriptions for an entire account are tracked through a
.I subscription management service.

.PP
With the channel-based framework, a subscription management service was either an on-premise Satellite or hosted Red Hat Network Classic. With the new certificate-based subscriptions, the subscription management service is either Customer Portal Subscription Management or Subscription Asset Manager. The differences between the two types of subscription management services are described in this Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/63269>

.PP
The system registers with the subscription management service and receives an inventory ID number. When subscriptions are attached to a system, that association is noted in the subscription management service.

.PP
Registering with a subscription management service is exclusive. If a system is registered with Red Hat Network Classic, it cannot simultaneously be registered with Customer Portal Subscription Management. The
.B rhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm
tool is provided specifically so that there is a way to transition from the deprecated Red Hat Network Classic to Customer Portal Subscription Management or an on-premise Subscription Asset Manager.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h, --help
Prints the specific help information for the given command.

.TP
.B -f, --force
Ignore channels not available through Customer Portal Subscription Management (or Subscription Asset Manager). The channels in Red Hat Network Classic are mapped to the product certificates used by the Customer Portal Subscription Management. However, not every channel has a certificate mapping, which can cause errors during migration. Using this option skips any channels which are not mapped to Customer Portal Subscription Management.

.TP
.B -n, --no-auto
Deletes the system from Red Hat Network Classic and registers it to Customer Portal Subscription Management, but does not attach any subscriptions to the system.

.TP
.B -s SERVICE_LEVEL, --servicelevel=SERVICE_LEVEL
Sets a preferred service level for the system, such as premium or standard. This service level preference is then used as one of the criteria for auto-attaching subscriptions to the system.

.TP
.B --org=ORG
Sets the organization within the account structure to which to register the system. Every account is divided into subgroups called \fIorganizations\fP, which represent some kind of organizational or logical division in the infrastructure. Organizations are further divided into \fIenvironments\fP, which organize content streams.

.TP
.B --environment=ENVIRONMENT
Sets which environment within the organization the system belongs to. Every account is divided into subgroups called \fIorganizations\fP, which are further divided into \fIenvironments\fP Environments define different content streams.

.TP
.B --no-proxy
Disables or ignores any previous RHN proxy settings when migrating to the new subscription management service.

.TP
.B --legacy-user=LEGACY_USER
Specifies the user name on the legacy server.

.TP
.B --legacy-password=LEGACY_PASSWORD
Specifies the password for the user on the legacy server.

.TP
.B --destination-url=URL
Specifies the URL of the subscription management service to which to register the system. This is used for environments which have an on-premise subscription management service such as Subscription Asset Manager. If no URL is given, the migration tool uses the Customer Portal Subscription Management Service.

.TP
.B --destination-user=DESTINATION_USER
Specifies the user name on the destination server.

.TP
.B --destination-password=DESTINATION_PASSWORD
Specifies the password for the user on the destination server.

.SH USAGE
The migration process moves the system from the inventory in one subscription management service (Red Hat Network Classic) to the new subscription management service (Customer Portal Subscription Management), and then re-applies the subscriptions to the system. The script runs through these steps:

.IP
1. Authenticate to both Red Hat Network Classic and Customer Portal Subscription Management to verify the account settings.

.IP
2. Get a channel list for the system.

.IP
3. Match each channel to a corresponding certificate map.

.IP
4. Copy over the product certificates for the old channels.

.IP
5. Unregister from Red Hat Network Classic.

.IP
6. Register with Customer Portal Subscription Management and auto-attach the best-matched subscriptions.

.PP
After migration, the system facts maintained by Subscription Manager display what script was used for migration and what the previous system ID was.
.nf
[root@server ~]# subscription-manager facts --list | grep migr
migration.classic_system_id: 09876
migration.migrated_from: rhn_hosted_classic
migration.migration_date: 2012-09-14T14:55:29.280519

.fi

.SS MIGRATION AND AUTOSUBSCRIBE
The \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP tool, by default, auto-attaches the best-matching subscriptions to the system. This allows migrations to be automated.

.PP
The script prompts for a username and password to use to register the system; this same account is used to authenticate with both Red Hat Network Classic and Customer Portal Subscription Management.

.PP
Optionally, the \fB--servicelevel\fP argument sets an SLA preference to use with the system. The SLA associated with a subscription is then evaluated when determining what subscriptions to auto-attach to the system, along with other factors like installed products, existing channel assignments, and architecture.

.SS MIGRATION TO ON-PREMISE SERVICES
The \fBrhn-migrate-classic-to-rhsm\fP tool migrates the system to Customer Portal Subscription Management (hosted) services by default. This uses the default configuration for Subscription Manager, which points to the subscription management services for the Customer Portal. For infrastructures which have an on-premise subscription management service such as Subscription Asset Manager, this configuration can be changed so that the migration process registers the systems to the on-premise subscription management service and attaches the appropriate subscriptions.

.PP
This is done by using the \fB--destination-url\fP option, which specifies the URL of the on-premise service. In this case, the authorization credentials must also be given for the on-premise subscription management service account (which is independent of the RHN account).
