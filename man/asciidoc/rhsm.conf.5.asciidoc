NAME
----
rhsm.conf - Configuration file for the subscription-mananager tooling


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The rhsm.conf file is the configuration file for various subscription
manager tooling. This includes *subscription-manager*,
*subscription-manager-gui*, *rhsmcertd*, and *virt-who*.


[server] OPTIONS
----------------
hostname::
  The hostname of the subscription service being used. The default is the
  Red Hat Customer Portal which is subscription.rhsm.redhat.com.
  This default should not be retrofitted to previously installed versions.
  It should be incorporated as the default going forward.

prefix::
  Server prefix where the subscription service is registered.

port::
  The port which the subscription service is listening on.

insecure::
  This flag enables or disables certification verification using the
  certificate authorities which are installed in /etc/rhsm/ca.

proxy_hostname::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use a
  proxy to access the subscription service. This sets the host
  for the proxy. Overrides hostname from *HTTP_PROXY* and
  *HTTPS_PROXY* environment variables.

proxy_port::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use a
  proxy to access the subscription service. This sets the port
  for the proxy. Overrides port from *HTTP_PROXY* and
  *HTTPS_PROXY* environment variables.

proxy_username::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use an
  authenticated proxy to access the subscription service. This
  sets the username for the proxy. Overrides username from
  *HTTP_PROXY* and *HTTPS_PROXY* environment variables.

proxy_password::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use an
  authenticated proxy to access the subscription service. This
  sets the username for the proxy. Overrides password from
  *HTTP_PROXY* and *HTTPS_PROXY* environment variables.

no_proxy::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should not use
  a proxy for specific hosts. Format is a comma-separated list of
  hostname suffixes, optionally with port. '*' is a special value that
  means don't use a proxy for any host. Overrides the *NO_PROXY*
  environment variable.

[rhsm] OPTIONS
--------------
baseurl::
  This setting is the prefix for all content which is managed by the
  subscription service. This should be the hostname for the Red Hat CDN,
  the local Satellite or Capsule depending on your deployment.
  Prefix depends on the service type. For the Red Hat CDN, the full
  *baseurl* is *https://cdn.redhat.com* . For Satellite 6, the baseurl is
  *https://HOSTNAME/pulp/repos* , so for a hostname of *sat6.example.com*
  the full *baseurl* would be for example:
  *https://sat6.example.com/pulp/repos* .

repomd_gpg_url::
  The URL of the GPG key that was used to sign this repository's metadata.
  The specified GPG key will be used in addition to any GPG keys defined
  by the entitlement.

ca_cert_dir::
  The location for the certificates which are used to communicate with the
  server and to pulldown content.

repo_ca_cert::
  The certificate to use for server side authentication during content
  downloads.

productCertDir::
  The directory where product certificates should be stored.

entitlementCertDir::
  The directory where entitlement certificates should be stored.

consumerCertDir::
  The directory where the consumers identity certificate is stored.

manage_repos::
  Set this to '1' if subscription manager should manage a yum repos file.
  If set, it will manage the file /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo. If set
  to '0' then the subscription is only used for tracking purposes, not
  content.

full_refresh_on_yum::
  Set to '1' if the /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo should be updated with
  every server command. This will make yum less efficient, but can ensure
  that the most recent data is brought down from the subscription service.

report_package_profile::
  Set to '1' if *rhsmcertd* should report the system's current package
  profile to the subscription service. This report helps the subscription
  service provide better errata notifications. If supported by the
  entitlement server, enabled repos, enabled modules, and packages present
  will be reported.

pluginDir::
  The directory to search for subscription manager plugins

pluginConfDir::
  The directory to search for plugin configuration files


[rhsmcertd] OPTIONS
-------------------
certCheckInterval::
  The number of minutes between runs of the *rhsmcertd* daemon

autoAttachInterval::
  The number of minutes between attempts to run auto-attach on this
  consumer.
