	<para>
		Effective asset management requires a mechanism to handle the software inventory &mdash; both the type of products and the number of systems that the software is installed on. The subscription service provides that mechanism and gives transparency into both global allocations of subscriptions for an entire organization and the specific subscriptions assigned to a single system.
	</para>

			<para>
				The basis of software management is a <emphasis>subscription</emphasis>. A subscription contains both the <emphasis>products</emphasis> that are available, the support levels, and the <emphasis>quantities</emphasis>, or number of servers, that the product can be installed on.
			</para>
			<para>
				Subscriptions are managed though the Certificate-Based Red Hat Network service, which ties into the Subscription and Content Delivery Network (CDN).
			</para>
			<para>
				The subscription service maintains a complete list of subscriptions for an organization, identified by a unique ID (called a <emphasis>pool ID</emphasis>). A system is <emphasis>registered</emphasis>, or added, to the subscription service to allow it to manage the subscriptions for that system. Like the subscription, the system is also added to the subscription service inventory and is assigned a unique ID within the service. The subscriptions and system entries, together, comprise the <emphasis>inventory</emphasis>.
			</para>
			<para>
				A system allocates one of the quantities of a product in a subscription to itself. When a subscription is consumed, it is an <emphasis>entitlement</emphasis>. (An entitlement is roughly analogous to a user license, in that it grants all of the rights to that product to that system. Unlike a user license, an entitlement does not grant the right to <emphasis>use</emphasis> the software; with the subscription model, an entitlement grants the ability to download the packages and receive updates.) Because the available quantity in a subscription lowers once a system subscribes to it, the system <emphasis>consumes</emphasis> the subscription.
			</para>
			<para>
				The repository where the product software is located is organized according to the <emphasis>product</emphasis>. Each product group within
				the repository may contain the primary software packages and then any required dependencies or associated packages. Altogether, the product and its
				associated packages are called a <emphasis>content set</emphasis>. (A content set for a product even includes other versions of the product.)
				When a subscription grants access to a product, it includes access to all of the associated packages in that content set.
			</para>
			<para>
				A single subscription can have multiple products, and each system can have multiple different subscriptions, depending on how many entitlement certificates are loaded on the machine.
			</para>

		<primary>entitlements</primary>
		<secondary>hardware compatibility</secondary>
	</indexterm>
			<para>
				Any number of products, for any number of different architectures, can be contained in a single subscription. The subscription options that are visible to a consumer are filtered, by default, according to whether the architecture for the product matches the architecture of the system. This is <emphasis>compatibility</emphasis>. Depending on compatible subscriptions makes sure that subscriptions are allocated efficiently, only to systems which can actually use the products.
			</para>
			<para>
				Some subscriptions define some element count on the consumer, like the number of sockets on the machine, the number of virtual guests on a host, or the number of clients in a domain. Multiple subscriptions can be combined together to cover the counts on the consumer.
				<!--	For example, if there is a four socket server, two subscriptions for "RHEL Server for Two Sockets" can be consumed by the system to cover the socket count. Combining multiple subscriptions to cover the system count is called <emphasis>stacking</emphasis>.
				-->
			</para>
			<para>
				The subscription tools can display even incompatible entitlements. Alternatively, the architecture definition for the system can be overridden by defining custom system facts for the subscription tools to use.
			</para>
			<para>
				It is important to distinguish between subscribing to a product and installing a product. A subscription is essentially a statement of whatever products an organization has purchased. The act of subscribing to a subscription means that a system is allowed to install the product with a valid certificate, but subscribing does not actually perform any installation or updates. In the reverse, a product can also be installed apart from any entitlements for the system; the system is just does not have a valid product certificate. Certificate-Based Red Hat Network and the Content Delivery Network harmonize with content delivery and installation by using <command>yum</command> plug-ins that come with the Subscription Manager tools.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Red Hat Subscription Manager UI has a single window with tabbed sections that offer quick views into the current state of the system, showing installed products, subscriptions for the system, and available subscriptions the system has access to. These tabs also allow administrators to manage subscriptions by subscribing and unsubscribing the system.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Red Hat Subscription Manager has three main areas to manage products and subscriptions:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <guibutton>My Subscriptions</guibutton> area shows all of the current entitlements that the system is subscribed to.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <guibutton>Available Subscriptions</guibutton> area shows all of the subscriptions that are available to the system. The default displays only entitlements that are compatible with the hardware, but these can be filtered to show entitlements corresponding to other installed programs, only subscriptions that have not been installed, and subscriptions based on date.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <guibutton>My Installed Software</guibutton> area shows the currently installed products on the system, along with their subscription status. This does not allow administrators to install software, only to view installed software.
					</para>

				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			<para>
				The top right box contains the tools required to perform maintenance tasks like changing the registration connection information and viewing system facts.

		<para>
			Entitlements are managed by organizing and maintaining the systems which use entitlement subscriptions. The entitlements and subscriptions are managed by Red Hat through the subscription service. A system is recognized to the subscription service by being <emphasis>registered</emphasis> with the service. The subscription service assigns the system (called a <emphasis>consumer</emphasis>) a unique ID (essentially as an inventory number) and issues that system an identifying certificate (with the UUID in its subject CN) to identify that system.
		</para>
		<para>
			Whenever a subscription is purchased by an organization, the consumer can <emphasis>subscribe</emphasis> to that subscription. This means that a portion of the subscription is allocated to that consumer ID; when the consumer contacts the content delivery network and downloads the software, the licenses have been already assigned to the system. The system has valid certificates for its subscriptions.
		</para>
		<para>
			Systems can be registered with an subscription service during the firstboot process or as part of the kickstart setup (both described in the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>). Systems can also be registered after they have been configured or removed from the subscription service inventory (unregistered) if they will no longer be managed within that entitlement system.

		<sect2 id="registering-multiorg"><title>Registering Consumers to a Local Distributor (Organization)</title>
			<para>
				Subscription services can be hosted by a company locally rather than by Red Hat's hosted services. The local subscription service receives information about its available subscriptions from Red Hat and then parcels them out to the local systems. This local subscription service is called a <emphasis>distributor</emphasis>. Distributors include applications like Subscription Asset Manager and CloudForms System Engine.
			</para>
			<para>
				Infrastructures which manage their own local content repository and subscription service must have a defined
				<emphasis>organization</emphasis>. This organization is essentially a group definition, and systems must be
				assigned to that group as part of the registration process. This allows there to be multiple, discrete organizations or
				tenants within the infrastructure.

				Some subscriptions define a <emphasis>count</emphasis> which works as a restriction on the subscription. For example, counts can be set on the number of sockets or CPUs on a machine,

		<para>
			With Subscription Manager, the act of <emphasis>registering</emphasis> a system can be separate from the act of <emphasis>subscribing</emphasis> the system to entitlements. This separation actually allows a fair amount of flexibility in how administrators allocate subscriptions, and even allows administrators to force specific subscriptions to a system when the logic of an automatic subscription process may prevent that subscription.
		</para>

The <emphasis>level</emphasis> defines how quickly support is guaranteed to respond to a case.

			The Red Hat Subscription Manager provides a series of log and UI messages that indicate any changes to the valid certificates of any installed products for a system. In the Subscription Manager GUI,
			the status of the system entitlements are color-coded, where <emphasis>green</emphasis> means all products are fully subscribed, <emphasis>yellow</emphasis>
			means that some products may not be subscribed but updates are still in effect, and <emphasis>red</emphasis> means that updates are disabled.

		</para>
		<para>
			As any installed product nears the expiration date of the subscription, the Subscription Manager daemon will issue a warning. A similar message is given when the system has products without a valid certificate, meaning either the system is not subscribed to a subscription that entitles that product or the product is installed past the expiration of the subscription. Clicking the <guilabel>Manage My Subscriptions...</guilabel> button in the subscription notification window opens the Red Hat Subscription Manager GUI to view and update subscriptions.
		</para>

			The left corner of the <guilabel>My Installed Products</guilabel> tab has a small icon that indicates the overall status of subscriptions on the system. <emphasis>Green</emphasis> means all products are fully subscribed, <emphasis>yellow</emphasis>

The total number of products which do not have valid subscriptions is listed at the text summary at the top of the <guilabel>My Installed Products</guilabel> tab.
