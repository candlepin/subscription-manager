Functional Tests
================

How to run functional tests?

* You have to run deploy script of candlepin server with options `-gtar`, because tests use testing
  repositories generated by deploy script and testing repositories are generated only in case, when
  `-r` option is used.

* Edit /etc/ansible/hosts and add at least one machine to the group called
  clients. E.g.:

  ```ini
  [clients]
  centos7.example.com
  ```

* You have to be able to login to all machines in group using ssh key
  (not password).

* Execute following commands:

  ```bash
  cd ./ansible_playbooks
  ansible-playbook ./configure_package_manager.yml --extra-vars="candlepin_hostname=<IP_OF_TESTING_CANDLEPIN>"
  ansible-playbook ./register_system.yml
  ansible-playbook ./test_install_remove_packages.yml
  ansible-playbook ./test_not_remove_prod_cert_for_disabled_repo.yml
  ```
