# In fixed-width output devices, Latin characters all occupy a single
# "cell" position of equal width, whereas ideographic CJK characters
# occupy two such cells. Interoperability between terminal-line
# applications and (teletype-style) character terminals using the
# UTF-8 encoding requires agreement on which character should advance
# the cursor by how many cell positions. No established formal
# standards exist at present on which Unicode character shall occupy
# how many cell positions on character terminals. These routines are
# a first attempt of defining such behavior based on simple rules
# applied to data provided by the Unicode Consortium.
