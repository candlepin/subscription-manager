RHSM & Cloud
============

This package contains modules for detecting cloud providers and collecting cloud metadata. The
metadata then can be for example reported in system facts. Three main cloud providers are
supported ATM: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. If you want to add
support for another cloud provider, then add subclasses of CloudProvider to module in `providers`
sub-package and modify list of supported classes in `provider.py`.

Example: you want to add support for Foo Cloud Provider. You will create package `fcp.py` in
folder `providers`. Content of `fcp.py` will look like this:

When implementation of cloud provider is finished, then please modify list of providers
in `rhsmlib/cloud/provider.py` accordingly:

```python
# List of detector classes with supported cloud providers
CLOUD_PROVIDERS = [
    ...,
    FooCloudProvider
]
```

When implementation of your cloud detector and collector is finished, then please implement some unit tests in
`test/rhsmlib_test/test_cloud.py` or you can implement tests first if you prefer test driven development.
