.TH SYSPURPOSE 8 "" "" "Subscription Management"
.SH NAME
syspurpose \- Set the intended purpose for this system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syspurpose
[\fICOMMAND\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fISyspurpose\fP is a utility for viewing and modifying system purpose
properties.
.PP
The properties (hints) set by \fIsyspurpose\fP are passed to a Red Hat
subscription management entitlement server (Customer Portal or Satellite 6) to
help attach the most appropriate subscriptions to the system automatically. The
entitlement server also reports whether the attached subscriptions match the
specified system purpose. Satisfying system purpose properties depends greatly
on the quantity, availability, and subscription SKU offerings that have been
purchased for the organization that the system is registered to.
.PP
The \fIset\fP, \fIunset\fP, \fIadd\fP, and \fIremove\fP commands modify the
local system purpose, and when possible will report the updated settings to the
Red Hat subscription management entitlement server (Customer Portal or Satellite
6).  The \fIshow\fP command displays the current system purpose.
