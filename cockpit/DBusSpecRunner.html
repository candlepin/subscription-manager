  <!-- NOTE: These scripts need to be loaded here and not as imports in the spec files.
       The load order has to be as follows.  If you try to import these, the load order
       can be messed up.  I suspect that in webpack in the browser, it uses asynchronous
       loading, but since we don't specify defer or async in the script tag, these files
       load synchronously -->
