DESCRIPTION

manager tooling. This includes *subscription-manager*,
*subscription-manager-gui*, *rhsmcertd*, and and *virt-who*.


[server] OPTIONS
----------------

  The hostname of the subscription service being used. The default is the
  Red Hat Customer Portal which is subscription.rhn.redhat.com.

prefix::
  Server perfix where the subscription service is registered.

  The port which the susbcription service is listening on.

insecure::
  This flag enables or disables certification verification using the
  certificate authorities which are installed in /etc/rhsm/ca.

ssl_verify_depth::
  Sets the number of certificates whcih should be used to verify the
  servers identity. This is an advanced control which can be used to
  secure on premise installations.

proxy_hostname::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use a
  reverse proxy to access the subscription service. This sets the host
  for the reverse proxy.

proxy_port::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use a
  reverse proxy to access the subscription service. This sets the port
  for the reverse proxy.

proxy_username::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use an
  authenticated reverse proxy to access the subscription service. This 
  sets the username for the reverse proxy.

proxy_password::
  Set this to a non-blank value if *subscription-manager* should use an
  authenticated reverse proxy to access the subscription service. This 
  sets the password for the reverse proxy.

[rhsm] OPTIONS
--------------
baseurl::
  This setting is the prefix for all content which is managed by the
  subscription service. This should be the hostname for the Red Hat CDN,
  the local Satellite or Capsule depending on your deployment.

ca_cert_dir::
  The location for the certificates which are used communicate with the
  server and to pulldown content.

repo_ca_cert::
  The certificate to use for server side authentication during content
  downloads.

productCertDirectory::

entitlementCertDirectory::
  The directory where entitlement certificates should be stored.

consumerCertDirectory::
  The directory where the consumers identity certificate is stored.

manage_repos::
  Set this to '1' if subscription manager should manage a yum repos file.
  If set, it will manage the file /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo. If set
  to '0' then the subscription is only used for tracking purposes, not
  content.

full_refresh_on_yum::
  Set to '1' if the /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo should be updated with
  every server command. This will make yum less efficient, but can ensure
  that the most recent data is brought down from the susbcription service.

  Set to '1' if *rhsmcertd* should report up the current package profile.
  This reporting helps the subscription service to provide better errata
  notifications.

  The directory to search for plugin configuration files


[rhsmcertd] OPTIONS

  The number of minutes between attempts to run auto-attach on this
  consumer.
